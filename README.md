## Features
The Vimeo Recorder is built on top of Unity's native `MediaEncoder` to make it simple to capture your Unity scene and share to Vimeo. Features include:
* Easy Vimeo uploading: Customize your video title, privacy levels, downloads, and which project to add it to.
* Record up to 4K video
* Record 360 and stereo 360 video and publish to Vimeo's 360 platform
* Record from the Unity Editor on Windows and Mac. 
* Adjustable capture frame rate
* Record in real-time or render offline
* Control recording length manually, by duration, or via a custom script
* Automatically post your video to a Slack channel of your choice after it's done recording to get feedback from your team.
* _\***NEW**\*_ The Vimeo Recorder is now compatiable with [AVPro Movie Capture](http://renderheads.com/product/av-pro-movie-capture/). You should go check out their full feature list, but here are some of the most notable improvements:
  * Extremely robust & higher quality video recording 
  * Works in the editor and also in standalone builds
  
## Requirements
* Requires a basic [Vimeo account](https://vimeo.com) or higher. 
* Unity `2017.2` or higher.

## Getting started

### 1. Setup

We provide a simple demo scene in the `Vimeo/Scenes` folder called `Recorder`. The `Recorder` scene contains the prefab, `[VimeoRecorder]`. Select it and in the component inspector you'll see the recording settings.

In order to add the Vimeo recorder in your own Unity scene simply go to the menu, `GameObject > Video > Vimeo Recorder`. You can also right-click in your Game Hierarchy and go to `Video > Vimeo Recorder`.

Sign into your Vimeo account by clicking `Get Token`. After you authorize Unity with Vimeo, copy the token, paste it into the `Vimeo Token` field, and click `Sign into Vimeo`.

### 2. Recording
Once you're signed in, all you have to do is click the `Start Recording` button. When you're done recording, click `Finish & Upload`.

## Control recording via a script
Probably the most powerful part about this plugin is that you can control recording via a script. Below is a simple code snippet on how you would do that. 

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Vimeo.Recorder;

public class CustomRecorder : MonoBehaviour {
  VimeoRecorder recorder;

  void Start() {
    recorder = gameObject.GetComponent<VimeoRecorder>();
    recorder.defaultVideoInput = Vimeo.Recorder.VideoInputType.Camera;		
    recorder.defaultResolution = Vimeo.Recorder.Resolution.x2160p_4K;
    recorder.defaultAspectRatio = Vimeo.Recorder.AspectRatio.x16_9;
    recorder.frameRate = 60;
    recorder.recordMode = Vimeo.Recorder.RecordMode.Duration;
    recorder.recordDuration = 5; // in seconds

    recorder.videoName = "My Custom Video";
    recorder.privacyMode = Vimeo.Services.VimeoApi.PrivacyModeDisplay.HideThisFromVimeo;
    recorder.autoPostToChannel = false; 

    recorder.OnUploadComplete += UploadComplete;

    recorder.BeginRecording();
  }
  
  void UploadComplete() 
  {
    Debug.Log("Uploaded to Vimeo!");
    // Now you could change the scene and then immediately queue up another recording.
    // ...
    // recorder.BeginRecording();
  }
}

```

In this sample, `CustomRecorder` is assuming that it is a part of the same GameObject as the `VimeoRecorder`. All the settings that are avaiable in the editor GUI can be controlled via code.

# Streaming
The SDK comes with the following example Unity scenes in the `Vimeo/Scenes` folder. Please note these demos don't work out of the box. You will need to authorize your Vimeo account and select your own video test.

## Streaming Features
* Vimeo Streaming leverages Unity's native `VideoPlayer` behind the scenes.
* 4K video (on supported hardware)
* 360 and stereo 360 video (equirectangular)
* Select your preferred streaming video quality
* Search for your Vimeo video within the Unity Editor, or manually specify via URL
* Easy to use GUI and drag & drop components
* _\***NEW**\*_ We are now compatible with [AVPro Video](http://renderheads.com/product/avpro-video/). You should go check out their full feature list, but here are some of the most notable improvements:
  * Versions for iOS, tvOS, macOS, Android, WebGL, Windows, Windows Phone and UWP
  * Adaptive video support. Vimeo supports HLS & DASH streaming. And with [Vimeo Live](https://vimeo.com/live) you can even livestream into Unity.
  * 8K video (on supported hardware)
  * VR support (mono, stereo, equirectangular and cubemap)
  

## Streaming Requirements
* Unity `5.6.0` or higher.
* Streaming Vimeo videos requires video file access via the Vimeo API. Accessing video files is limited to [Vimeo Pro and Business](https://vimeo.com/upgrade) customers. 
* You can only stream videos from your own Vimeo account. Access to all videos is limited to partnership-level integrations. If you are interested in a partnership, reach out to casey@vimeo.com

## Setting up
### 1. Choose your playback method
Open up your Unity scene or create a new one. For streaming any Vimeo video, you will be using the `VimeoPlayer` component. There are two ways to setup the Vimeo player in Unity:

#### Prefab setup
The easiest way to get started is to either drag in one of the prefabs from `Vimeo/Resources/Prefabs` or simply right-click on your scene and the Vimeo Player from the `Video` menu:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LYO4k95.gif" width="500" />

#### Manual setup 
If you are setting up your own scene and want to specify your video "screen" and audio outputs, you can add the `Vimeo Player` component to your GameObject. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/F9aGHYD.gif"  />

### 2. Sign into your Vimeo account
Sign into your [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) account (or create one if you haven't already) and make sure you have some videos uploaded. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/P8F3A6y.gif"  />

* Click the "Get Token" button which will ask you to authorize with your Vimeo account. 
* After authorizing, copy the token and paste it into the `Vimeo Token` field in Unity. 
* [Find your video](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos) and then copy the full URL or the video ID and paste it into the `Vimeo Video URL` field.
* If you are not using one of the existing prefabs, then you will need to assign a GameObject to the `Video Screen` field. Currently, we only support Mesh and RawImage GameObjects.
* `Audio Output` is optional. If left empty, a new audio object will be attached to the video screen. 
* For security reasons, the Vimeo token is not saved into the scene. But, if you plan on building this app so others can watch video, then be sure to check `Save token with scene`
 
 You're all set! Press play and you should now see your Vimeo video streaming in your app.

# Vimeo & AVPro
If you're looking for an even more robust streaming and/or recording solution, we have integrated into AVPro's [Video](http://renderheads.com/product/avpro-video/) and [Movie Capture](http://renderheads.com/product/av-pro-movie-capture/) plugins. 

After installing either of AVPro's tools, the Vimeo plugin will automatically detect AVPro and a new option will appear.

### Streaming with AVPro Video and Vimeo
The `Vimeo Player` component will now show a `Video Player` dropdown letting you to switch between Unity's native video player and `AVPro Video`. After selecting AVPro, you will need to assign their `Media Player` to the Vimeo Player component. Now when you run Unity, the Vimeo Player will automatically set the URL in the `Media Player`.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hxnYP7L.png" />

### Recording with AVPro Movie Capture and Vimeo
The `Vimeo Recorder` component will now show a `Video Encoder` dropdown letting yo uswitch between Unity's native `Media Encoder` and `AVPro Movie Capture`. Select AVPro Movie Capture and assign the Capture component. Now when you record with AVPro's tools, Vimeo will automatically upload the video after it is finished recording.
